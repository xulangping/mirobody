Twenty-eight. Verify ECS reduced for launch. Verified. Status check. Go Atlas. Go Centaur. Go Amazon Leo. Ten. T-minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three. We have ignition. Two, one, and liftoff of the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket carrying twenty-seven satellites for Amazon Leo. Spacecraft delivering fast, reliable internet to customers around the world. We're all closed loop control. Engaging 1st stage segment as expected. And we've completed our pitch program. The drives continue to look good. Successfully completed roll program.
Please remain seated. Engine continues to operate as expected. Mach 1, Atlas V is now supersonic. Engine continues to operate as expected. You're hearing Sarah Bailey Glasgow providing launch vehicle sound data. Vehicle is now 6 mi in altitude, 2 mi downrange. Atlas continues to move down center of the range track. Now passing 1 min into flight. Body rates continue to look good. Engine operating as expected. Throttling down, engine continues to burn normally. Atlas is now moving at 2800 miles an hour and is 12 miles downrange. Vehicle is now one half of its lift off weight.
Max Q passing through maximum dynamic pressure. And we have good indication of SRB burnout. Throttling up as expected. And we have good indication of separation of all five SRBs and engine continues to burn normally. We just heard confirmation of solid rocket booster jettison. These additional motors augmented the thrust at liftoff to give the Atlas rocket an extra boost to reach its circular low Earth orbit destination. We're coming up on our next mission event, jettison of the payload fairing. Let's listen in. Body rates are smooth. Two minutes to a nominal BCO.
Vehicle continues to move down the center of the range track. Holding acceleration at two and a half Gs in preparation for payload fairing jettison. Centaur reaction control system pressurizing to flight levels as expected. Vehicle has passed the Karman line; we've exited Earth's atmosphere. Atlas is now one 4th of its liftoff weight. Engine continues to burn as expected. And we have good indication of payload fairing jettison. And CFLR deck jettison. Throttling back up as expected. Flight commentator Sarah Bailey Glasgow just called out confirmation of payload fairing jettison. The composite fairing protects the spacecraft as it pushes through the harshest parts of Earth's atmosphere. Next.
Next, we'll hear callouts for cutoff of the Atlas 1st stage engine and separation of the booster stage, followed by ignition of ULA's Centaur 2nd stage engine. These events occur when the 1st stage has escaped Earth's atmosphere, getting above the Karman line and into space. The Centaur upper stage with the Amazon LEO satellites attached then takes over on a trajectory to a precise location in space. Let's listen in as we approach these milestones. Boost phase chill down in progress. Temperatures are operating as expected. Engine continues to burn nominally. PU has gone to open loop control. Boost phase chill down complete. Temperatures operating as expected. And we have successful cutoff.
And good indication of centaur separation. Pre-start on fuel unlocks, good staging. Ignition and full thrust. Arlington is running nominally.
